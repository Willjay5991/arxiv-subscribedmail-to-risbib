AB  - High-performance analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuits are mainly
full-custom designed, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. A
significant portion of the effort is experience-driven, which makes the
automation of AMS circuit design a formidable challenge. Large language models
(LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for Electronic Design Automation (EDA)
applications, fostering advancements in the automatic design process for
large-scale AMS circuits. However, the absence of high-quality datasets has led
to issues such as model hallucination, which undermines the robustness of
automatically generated circuit designs. To address this issue, this paper
introduces AMSnet-KG, a dataset encompassing various AMS circuit schematics and
netlists. We construct a knowledge graph with annotations on detailed
functional and performance characteristics. Facilitated by AMSnet-KG, we
propose an automated AMS circuit generation framework that utilizes the
comprehensive knowledge embedded in LLMs. We first formulate a design strategy
(e.g., circuit architecture using a number of circuit components) based on
required specifications. Next, matched circuit components are retrieved and
assembled into a complete topology, and transistor sizing is obtained through
Bayesian optimization. Simulation results of the netlist are fed back to the
LLM for further topology refinement, ensuring the circuit design specifications
are met. We perform case studies of operational amplifier and comparator design
to verify the automatic design flow from specifications to netlists with
minimal human effort. The dataset used in this paper will be open-sourced upon
publishing of this paper.

AB  - Managing resources effectively in uncertain demand, variable availability,
and complex governance policies is a significant challenge. This paper presents
a paradigmatic framework for addressing these issues in water management
scenarios by integrating advanced physical modelling, remote sensing
techniques, and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. The proposed approach
accurately predicts water availability, estimates demand, and optimizes
resource allocation on both short- and long-term basis, combining a
comprehensive hydrological model, agronomic crop models for precise demand
estimation, and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming for efficient resource
distribution. In the study case of the Segura Hydrographic Basin, the approach
successfully allocated approximately 642 million cubic meters ($hm^3$) of water
over six months, minimizing the deficit to 9.7% of the total estimated demand.
The methodology demonstrated significant environmental benefits, reducing CO2
emissions while optimizing resource distribution. This robust solution supports
informed decision-making processes, ensuring sustainable water management
across diverse contexts. The generalizability of this approach allows its
adaptation to other basins, contributing to improved governance and policy
implementation on a broader scale. Ultimately, the methodology has been
validated and integrated into the operational water management practices in the
Segura Hydrographic Basin in Spain.
